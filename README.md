# Hearth Attack Prediction
## AI Supervised learning from data
***Created in June 2021***

---

## Description
- Program using machine learning classification algorithm has to decide, based on the data vector, whether a person could have hearth attack or not.
- As part of learning 4 different classification algorithms was used and compared:

1. **KNN**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **SVN**

## Train and test data
- Data used to train and test describe values read from the sensors and decision of two values, yes - 1 or not - 0.
- train data shape (227, 15)
- test data shape (76, 115)

## All data Results 
Algorithm       | max accuracy I reached    |
 -------------- | ------------------------- |
KNN             |           82.9%           |
Decision Tree   |           89.5%           |
Random Forest   |           88.2%           |
SVN             |           86.8%           |

Considering all input vector data equally useful is the best classifier is Random Forest.

Using previously trained Random Forest it is easy to conclude what parts of input data are most useful.

The moment that data was processed using these importances information results of classification was much better:

## Part of data Results
Algorithm       | max accuracy I reached    |
 -------------- | ------------------------- |
KNN             |           100.%           |
Decision Tree   |           100.%           |
Random Forest   |           98.7%           |
SVN             |           100.%           |
